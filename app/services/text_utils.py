"""Shared text utilities: tokenization and a small English stopword list.

The lexical components (hashing embedder, extractive generator) score token
overlap. Filtering stopwords removes high-frequency noise words that would
otherwise dominate similarity and pull irrelevant passages to the top. The real
semantic embedder (sentence-transformers) does not need this, but it does not
hurt it either.
